# Learning HDL by doing

Based on the project of [The Chip Maker](https://github.com/TheChipMaker/VHDL-100-Projects-List), the idea is to learn VHDL by building one step at a time.

Each project is self-contained unless otherwise stated Test-benches will be added to each project.

## Stage 1: Combinatorial Logic

### Gates
These beginner projects will serve me to explore TCL scripts and waveform storing. I will be storing `Vivado` projects and waveforms can be seen in later with `gtkwave`. 

 - AND
 
### Multiplexers

### Demultiplexers

### Encoders

### Decoders

### Comparators

### Miscellaneous
